### ðŸ”¬ Project Overview

This project explored how SEM-EDS provides high-resolution imaging and elemental analysis to solve real-world criminal cases.

* **Core Technology:** Explained the fundamentals of SEM for generating high-resolution surface topology images and EDS for identifying the elemental composition of a sample.
* **Forensic Applications:** Detailed the use of SEM-EDS in key forensic areas, including:
    * **Gunshot Residue Analysis:** Identifying particles to determine firearm and ammunition type.
    * **Fiber Analysis:** Differentiating between natural and synthetic fibers to link suspects to crime scenes.
    * **Paint Chip Analysis:** Identifying the make and model of vehicles from microscopic paint evidence.
* **Case Studies:** Analyzed case studies where SEM-EDS provided critical information that was instrumental in criminal investigations, such as refuting defense claims in a gunshot residue case.
